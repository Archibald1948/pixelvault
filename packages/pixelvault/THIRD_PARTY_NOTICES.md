## jpeg-encoder — portions derived from the Independent JPEG Group's software

**This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.**

```
jpeg-encoder IJG License
========================

The jpeg-encoder crate declares license "(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND IJG".
The published crate includes MIT and Apache license files, but it does not
currently include a top-level IJG license file. This Chromium-local file
documents the IJG terms for the IJG-derived portions of jpeg-encoder until the
crate publishes the missing license file upstream.

The IJG-derived portions include, at least:

- src/fdct.rs, which is ported from mozjpeg to Rust and states that it was part
  of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
- src/avx2/fdct.rs, which is ported from mozjpeg / jfdctint-avx2.asm to Rust
  and states that it is based on the x86 SIMD extension for the IJG JPEG
  library.

In the IJG terms below, "this software" refers to the IJG-derived portions of
jpeg-encoder listed above, not to the jpeg-encoder crate as a whole. The rest
of jpeg-encoder remains covered by the crate's MIT OR Apache-2.0 terms.

Conditions of distribution and use
==================================

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".
